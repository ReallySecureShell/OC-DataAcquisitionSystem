## Description
This script is used to gather data on Applied Energistics 2 networks. This data will be sent over a point-to-point connection, and encrypted for extra security.

## Setup
To install, ensure your computer has an `Internet Card`, then run the command: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReallySecureShell/OC-DataAcquisitionSystem/main/FacilityMasterControlUnit.lua` while in /etc/rc.d.
After downloading the script, you may remove the `Internet Card`.

Then, review the example in this repository: `examples/rc.cfg`, in-order to properly configure the script.

### Message format
The format of the message is as follows:
```
HEADER
ComputerID:string        - The UUID of *this* computer.
sessionPublicKey:string  - Serialized public key generated by *this* computer.
                           The receiver will use it to decrypt the message.
iv:string                - Initialization Vector is generated everytime a
                           message is sent. This is used for encryption.

DATA
timestamp:string   - day/month/year hour:minute:second (24-hour)
cUUID:string       - Full UUID of ME Controller
energy:number      - The REAL amount of FE the subnet is using.
itemsInNetwork:table   - Amount of items stored within the subnet. 
fluidsInNetwork:table  - Amount of liquid stored within the subnet.
```
The data contained within `HEADER` is unencrypted. However, all data within
`DATA` is encrypted.

The following is the code which defines the structure of the message:
```lua
local __packet =
{
    header =
    {
        computerID          = computer.address(), -- A constant, so it's generated once per execution.
        sessionPublicKey    = nil,
        iv                  = nil
    },

    data = nil
}
```
